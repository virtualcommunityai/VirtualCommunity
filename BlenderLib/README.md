# Typed Blender API

The original Blender API is very handful for small scripts & mini automation tools. However, they are not suited for large-scale project as they do not provide type information and in general does not follow the OOP principle. This lead to huge repository of ugly code that is almost impossible to maintein.

This module provides a OOP-based blender API that act as a level of proxy to common objects to interact with.
